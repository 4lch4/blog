# @4lch4/blog

This website is my "official" blog, where I'll post any/all of the following:

- My thoughts on various topics.
- Discuss projects that I'm working on/releasing.
- Whatever else comes to mind and doesn't quite fit in my [Digital Garden][2].

## Chat

If you'd like to chat for whatever reason, my Discord server and DMs are always open:
